# Fire-Detection
Simple mobile application to detect fire from mobile's camera. The application is designed to detect fire in the image based on the segmented image pixel cluster values in a mear microseconds to predict fire if any in the image.


# Background
With the advent of technology, it can be made easier for the authorities to alerted only when there is a valid threat. For this, we can use machine learning along with image processing to detect fire and propose if the threat is valid and then alert the authorities.

We can use various techniques to detect fire but with testing and research, it was found by me that the most appropriate one to use will be to cluster segmented pixel cluster to identify if the image sent to it has fire. This is to reduce the computation and processing time on mobile. This is because the model is defined in the application itself and the processing takes place in the mobile and APIs are called.


# Application Capabilities
The Application gives you the following capabilities
* Detect fire with the mobile camera module.
* Alert (SMS) authorities about the detected image.
* Alert along with the geo-location of the user about the fire report.
